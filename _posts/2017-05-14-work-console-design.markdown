What we need is a new desk! The old desk was geat but having the music production monitors on stools was not ideal. I will miss my Eames Aluminum Group office chair but I need a higher chair to accomidate my guitar playing. And I will now have a space for my keyboard. No excuse for not working on my progrock album now.

I've built a studo desk out of MDF and plywwood.  I have the intention of skinning the whole thing in Formica when I get the bucks.

The structure consits of 3/8" sandwiched mdf. I made sure one surface was the correct dimension and then flush router the edges. Quick and easy.

I use plywood for the desktop as the span was too large for MDF to hold up and not warp.

I think the monitor stand is warping a small amount and would recommend using plywood for both layers to increase rigidity.
