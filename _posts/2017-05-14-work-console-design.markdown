What we need is a new desk! The old desk was geat but having the music production monitors on stools was not ideal. I will miss my Eames Aluminum Group office chair but I need a higher chair to accomidate my guitar playing. And I will now have a space for my keyboard. No excuse for not working on my progrock album now.

So a new studo desk out of MDF and plywwood.  I have the intention of skining the whole thing in Formica when I get the bucks.
