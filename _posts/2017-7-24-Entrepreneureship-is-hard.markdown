The Compost Hero is well on it's way to market. I have made some minor changes to the business plan and now I'm working my way through all of the updates necessary to realize the plan.

Staying orgnized and keeping motivated is quite a project. I quite enjoy experaminting and descovering. At least for all of the projects that need hands on manual activitites. It's much harder to sit myself down at the computer for a few hours of work.

I find I need to strike a ballance between projects I enjoy, building, construction and gardening and projects that require stationary computer time.
