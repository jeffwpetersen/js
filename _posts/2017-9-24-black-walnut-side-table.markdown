I've recently finished a new table design.
Scandi : <strong>Black Walnut Side Table</strong>

I came across a chunk of Black Walnut at an estate sale. It had been siting in someones basement for quite a while.
The wood has a nice dense grain and I suspect it's an from an old growth tree.

I wanted to take advantage of the 1.25 inch thick board so I went with an end table design. I also had recently aquired a new bench planer and wanted to give my hand a try as curving my design by hand.

All the curves and bevels in the top and legs were done by hand.

Truly Hand Made.
