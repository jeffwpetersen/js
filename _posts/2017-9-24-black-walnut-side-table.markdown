I've recently finished a new table design. <strong>Scandi</strong> : Black Walnut Side Table

I came across a few board feet of Black Walnut that had been siting in someones basement for quite a while.
The wood has a nice dense grain and I suspect it's an from an old growth tree.

I wanted to take advantage of the 1.25 inch thick board so I went with an end table design. I also had recently acquired a new bench planer and wanted to give my hand a try at curving a edge.

Truly Hand Made.
